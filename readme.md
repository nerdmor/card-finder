# Proto's Card Sorter

## what is this
This project is mostly a personal tool to help me find cards when I'm building decks. It's meant to facilitate finding what cards I need when there are 100+ cards to find spread among several boxes and binders.

## how to deploy this?
Simply clone the project and open `index.html`.

## how do I contribute?
Clone the project and make a pull request :)

## But the code is a mess!
Yeah. This started as a personal project. I'm improving it slowly.

## Do you have a roadmap?
More like ideas that I want to implement, but yeah:
* Add a button to copy the current list to clipboard
* Add a filter for card types
* Add a way to sort using different attributes (card types, for example)
* Add options to let lands be considered as a color (current), colorless, or as the color that they influence (hard, but useful)
* Implement a way to use use Scryfall-like filters to the interface
Feel free to message me with suggestions

## It's 2023! Why are you using jQuery?
Because I know how to use it and it works well. I tend to use pure JS when possible, but some stuff just is easier with jQuery.

## Why aren't you using Vue or React?
Because I learned JS back in 2009 and I have absolutely no interest in learning a new frontend framework.
